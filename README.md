The repo represent the minimal viable UI test framework. 

This is a sample demo project that can be used as template to make UI test automation for any application on Windows, MAC and Linux

Demo tests are against Windows 10 calculator. There is a chance this wont work on your machine since UI looks different. Take a look at UI map and update images to match your OS calculator.

Please note that you should install Sikuli for your OS in SikuliX folder (look in SikuliX folder)

## Run tests 
In the root of test folder you have bat file that will start your smoke tests. Make sure that sikuli jar file is correctly set. After test run is done you will get html report file that is human readable  and xml files for integration with your CI server

## Edit UI map
Start sikuli jar and then open folder _uimap.sikuli
